# Cross Contract Analyzer

In the current blockchain environment, many tools focus on single smart contract vulnerability detection, but most security issues in the rapidly evolving DeFi sector arise from complex multi-contract interactions. To address this, we propose the "Cross Contract Analyzer", a new method that detects security vulnerabilities in multi-contract interactions by combining fuzzing principles with new strategies and technologies, tailored for the complex DeFi ecosystem.

# List of Past DeFi Incidents
- 2017/11/6 Parity - 'Accidentally Killed It' 

Try running some of the following test:

```shell
npx hardhat test test/parity_kill.ts
